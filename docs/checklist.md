# Implementation checklist

## Phase 0

- [x] Read and preserve the supplied implementation specification.
- [x] Create a fresh repository, dedicated branch and linked worktree; no remote.
- [x] Pin all three candidate skill repositories to full commits and archive hashes.
- [x] Inspect candidate files, referenced procedures, licenses, manifests and install surfaces.
- [x] Record per-file hashes and adopt/adapt/reject decisions; retain MIT notices.
- [x] Define Phase 1 requirements and threat model; distinguish future enforcement.

## Phase 1

- [x] Ten portable core skills with narrow triggers, prerequisites, outputs and stop conditions.
- [x] Seven initial domain procedures, loaded only when relevant.
- [x] Structured, versioned JSON handoffs and fail-closed offline validation.
- [x] Offline catalog, explicit intent selection, skill rendering and package checks.
- [x] Disposable synthetic tasks, negative contract cases and independent forward evaluation.
- [x] Document adaptations, tested platform, limitations and local PR proposal.

## Phase 2 — feasibility implementation, exit gate incomplete

- [x] Verify exact `72a3ccd` base, clean prior tree and all 29 foundation tests; create separate branch/worktree.
- [x] Read-only doctor with version/feature/auth/sandbox states; no global config changes.
- [x] Provider-neutral v1 records, separate wire adapters, redacted raw evidence and nullable usage.
- [x] Bounded process supervision, cancellation and same-group child cleanup.
- [x] Disposable failure fixtures and independent output oracle; no deliberate live quota exhaustion.
- [x] Real fake-credential, symlink, sibling, common Git metadata, loopback and process canaries.
- [x] One Claude live subscription call; accepted by corrected offline replay, original false-positive record retained.
- [x] Attempt Codex smoke under restrictions; preserve startup failure without relaxing guard.
- [x] Matrix, usage limitations, evidence, decisions and Phase 3 recommendation.
- [ ] Both engines complete a disposable live task: **Codex blocked** under the no-global-write guard.
- [ ] Tool-enabled credential/egress isolation: **unsupported**, not implied by native CLI sandbox flags.

See [detailed Phase 2 checklist](phase2-plan.md) and [validation report](phase2-validation-report.md).

## Later phases (planned, not implemented)

- [ ] Phase 3: trusted worktree broker, durable state, budgets and gated approvals.
- [ ] Phase 4: cross-provider roles and measured routing.
- [ ] Phase 5: hardware domain validation and optional GPU worker.
- [ ] Phase 6: GitHub broker, installation/update/rollback and machine handover.
- [ ] Phase 7: held-out matched baseline evaluations and calibrated release.

## Exit status

Phase 0 complete. Phase 1 offline foundation complete on the observed macOS/Python environment. All ten procedures were exercised across invoice, independent-review and optimisation development cases. Review found two outcome contradictions; both were fixed and independently rechecked. Required browser/GPU/provider boundaries remain explicitly unverified and are later-phase gates, not Phase 1 passes. The external skill-creator validator was unavailable due to missing PyYAML; local pack checks passed.

Phase 2 implementation and authorized feasibility experiments are recorded, with the full exit gate incomplete. No merge, push, PR, global CLI edit, plugin installation, GPU connection, API-key introduction or billing change occurred. Production delivery orchestration is not recommended yet; offline Phase 3 design/fixtures can proceed with execution disabled.

Publication follow-up, 2026-09-19: the user subsequently authorized creating a private GitHub repository and pushing all committed toolkit branches. This supersedes the local-only publication restriction without changing the Phase 2 findings or granting PR/merge permission. See D025 in the [decision log](decisions.md).
